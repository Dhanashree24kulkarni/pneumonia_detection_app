# Pneumonia Detection Web App (Deep Learning)

This project is a web application that uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect Pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

## Features
- Upload X-ray images and get instant prediction.
- Shows prediction result with accuracy.
- Color-coded results: Red = Pneumonia, Green = Normal.
- Simple and user-friendly frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Backend built using Flask (Python).
- Deep Learning model trained using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Deep Learning: TensorFlow / Keras CNN
